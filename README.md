Plays blind go against gnugo 3.8.

Currently, settings are hardcoded.
- gnugo is set at level 10
- human player takes black, gnugo takes black
- the board is 9x9

Things that may come if I can muster up some motivation:
- player versus player
- changeable settings (board size, difficulty)
- port to windows
- cheat modes to see the board mid game
- simple how-to to install from source

Things that won't come:
- this will not become a client app
